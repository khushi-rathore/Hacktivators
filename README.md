# AI Vulnerability Detection Assistant

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an AI-powered assistant that helps in detecting vulnerabilities in software systems. The assistant utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze code, identify potential security flaws, and provide recommendations for mitigation.

## Features

- **Code Analysis**: The assistant can analyze code snippets and source files to detect potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, etc.
- **Vulnerability Identification**: It identifies and categorizes vulnerabilities based on severity levels and impact on the system's security.
- **Recommendations**: Provides actionable recommendations and best practices for mitigating detected vulnerabilities.
- **Interactive Interface**: Offers an interactive interface for developers to query about security concerns, get explanations, and request guidance on secure coding practices.
- **Continuous Learning**: The assistant continuously learns from user interactions and updates its knowledge base to improve detection accuracy and recommendation quality over time.
